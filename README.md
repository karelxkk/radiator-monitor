# Radiator Monitor

Not much to see right now as I've just published this!

To compile it, you'll need to use ESP-IDF for the Bridge project and Nordic nRF Connect for the sensor

It's designed for use on an ESP32-C3 and Nordic nRF52840. I've been using the Seeed XIAO boards.

Both of these are available as add-ons to VSCode and that's how I've been building, compiling and flashing.

You'll need a J-Link piece of hardware to flash the Nordic boards at this time.
